# Homework 4 - Web APIs: Code Quiz
## Repository for Homework 4 - Code Quiz

The Web APIs Code Quiz was designed for students in a coding bootcamp to take a timed quiz on javaScript fundamentals that stores their scores in the local storage so they can monitor their progress in relation to their peers.

The first page greets the students and states the rules for taking the quiz. There is a timer set that runs for 90 seconds. They have a total of 90 seconds to take the quiz but for every incorrect answer the timer takes off an extra 10 seconds. Once they start the quiz they have to continue till the very end. When the last question is anwered they will be taken to the 'Finished' page.
The finished page announces the student is finished, where the timer stopped, their final score and there is an input field to enter their initials to be submitted to the local storage.
Once their initials are submitted the user is directed to the last page and displays their initials and high score. They can also clear their score and go back to the start.

## Installation

The files needed are all located inside the repository. The main folder (4Homework) needs to include the 'index.html' file, the 'style.css' file and the 'script.js' file. If the Folder contains those 3 files, the index.html file will be able to access the page and all that is needed to run the quiz successfully. 

## Usage

The webpage can be loaded based off of the index.html in the main repository.
Clicking the 'Start' button will run the quiz.

## Credits

A great example of this assignment was provided by:

My early pushes I basically just took his code and adjusted things to try and make it mine. It was not a good representation of where I am at. Later pushed I followed what he did and tried to put my own together and this is where I am at with major guidance.
